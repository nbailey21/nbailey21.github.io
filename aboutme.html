            <h1>Developer and CPA</h1>
              <p class="interest-descriptions" id="developer-description">
                I am a recent graduate of the Bloc Web Developer program. I am also a CPA.
                I was previously working as the accountant for many different tech start-ups in Denver and I greatly admired what these start-ups were doing.
                They were taking a new idea and developing a business from scratch with it.
                I became more and more interested in their projects. What they were doing looked so much more interesting.
                They were creating things. I decided to make the switch, so I could be doing what they were doing.

          <div class="traveler">
            <h1>World Traveler and Hiker</h1>
              <p class="interest-descriptions" id="traveler-description">
                I love seeing the world. I enjoy the people, the landmarks, the landscapes, the cultures, the nature, the arts, the journey and the food.
              </p>

          <div class="sports">
            <h1>Sports Fiend and Beer Lover</h1>
              <p class="interest-descriptions" id="sports-description">
                I have loved sports from an early age. I just love competition.
                I play pick-up and league basketball and volleyball regularly.
                I also watch sports live or on tv.
                Recently, I've enjoyed learning new sports or watching sports in different countries.
                My favorite example of this is Korean baseball. The games are full productions with choreographed cheers, dancers, mcs and singers.
                My teams are the Denver Nuggets, Kansas City Chiefs, Colorado Rockies, Colorado Buffs, and Colorado Avalanche.
